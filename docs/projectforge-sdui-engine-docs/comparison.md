## 1. RJSF (react-jsonschema-form)

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) — ⭐ 15 800 | [Docs](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) | [Playground](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rjsf/core) | [Themes](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form#supported-themes)

### What is this

React library for building web forms from JSON Schema. The most popular form-generation library for React.

### How it works

```jsx
<Form schema={schema} validator={validator} onSubmit={...} />
```

JSON Schema describes data types and constraints (`type`, `enum`, `minLength`, `pattern`, `format`). `uiSchema` describes appearance (`ui:widget`, `ui:order`, `ui:classNames`). RJSF maps schema types to React components (StringField → `<input>`, BooleanField → `<checkbox>`, NumberField → `<input type="number">`).

**[10 UI theme packages](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form#supported-themes):** Bootstrap 3/5, Material UI 7, Ant Design 5, Chakra UI 3, Fluent UI 9, Mantine, Semantic UI 2, Daisy UI 5, Shad CN.

### Key numbers

- [15 800+ stars](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form), [2 300+ forks](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/network/members), [2 000+ commits](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/commits/master)
- [280 releases](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/releases), latest [v6.5.2](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/releases/tag/v6.5.2) (May 2026)
- [10+ theme packages](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form#supported-themes), [19+ widget types](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/api-reference/widgets), [15+ field types](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/api-reference/field-components)
- Used by: [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [and others](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/network/dependents)

### When to choose RJSF

- Need **forms only** — not a full page layout engine
- Any backend language — just serves JSON Schema + uiSchema
- Want standard JSON Schema — many tools, validators, editors exist
- Small to medium forms without complex layout requirements

### When NOT to choose

- Need full control over layout (Row/Col/Fieldset composition)
- Need complex multi-section pages with tables and custom widgets
- Need server-side validation mapped back to fields
- Need enterprise features: access control, audit trail, i18n

### How servers store UI

```json
{
  "schema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "name": { "type": "string" } } },
  "uiSchema": { "name": { "ui:autofocus": true, "ui:placeholder": "Enter name" } }
}
```

### Key difference from ProjectForge

RJSF is a **client library** — server provides data schema, client renders forms. ProjectForge is a **server framework** — server controls layout structure, data types, actions, validation, and translations. RJSF gives you forms; ProjectForge gives you complete pages.

---

## 2. JSON Forms (EclipseSource)

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms) — ⭐ 1 800 | [Website](https://jsonforms.io/) | [Docs](https://jsonforms.io/docs/) | [Playground](https://jsonforms.io/examples/basic) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core)

### What is this

JSON Schema-based form framework with a separate UI Schema for layout control. Supports React, Angular, and Vue.

### How it works

```json
{
  "schema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "name": { "type": "string" } } },
  "uischema": {
    "type": "VerticalLayout",
    "elements": [
      { "type": "HorizontalLayout", "elements": [
        { "type": "Control", "scope": "#/properties/firstName" },
        { "type": "Control", "scope": "#/properties/lastName" }
      ]}
    ]
  }
}
```

Unlike RJSF, JSON Forms separates **data schema** (what data) from **UI schema** (how to display). UI Schema has first-class layout types: `VerticalLayout`, `HorizontalLayout`, `Group`, `Categorization` (tabs), `Label`.

### Key numbers

- [~1 800 GitHub stars](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms)
- [Framework bindings](https://jsonforms.io/docs/#frameworks): React, Angular, Vue (2 + 3)
- Maintained by [EclipseSource](https://eclipsesource.com/) (professional support available)
- [v3.7.0](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/releases) (latest)

### When to choose JSON Forms

- Need forms with better layout control than RJSF
- Multi-framework support (React + Angular + Vue simultaneously)
- Want standard JSON Schema + dedicated UI Schema
- Tab-based forms via `Categorization`

### When NOT to choose

- Need more than forms (tables, image upload, custom widgets)
- Need server-driven UI — JSON Forms is client-rendered
- Need complex enterprise layouts with tables and grids

### Key difference from ProjectForge

JSON Forms has the **closest layout model** to ProjectForge (VerticalLayout ↔ ProjectForge's Col, HorizontalLayout ↔ Row, Group ↔ Fieldset). But it's still form-only: no enterprise tables, no action system, no server-side validation mapping, no access control. ProjectForge goes further by making the layout fully server-controlled.

---

## 3. Formily (Alibaba)

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/alibaba/formily) — ⭐ 12 500 | [Docs](https://formilyjs.org/) | [Playground](https://formilyjs.org/zh-CN/guide/quick-start) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@formily/core)

### What is this

Cross-platform form framework from Alibaba. Designed for high-performance forms with reactive field-level state management.

### How it works

```
JSON Schema → @formily/json-schema → @formily/core → @formily/react → DOM
```

Each field has its own **reactive state** via `@formily/reactive` (Proxy-based). Changing one field does not re-render the entire form — only the changed field updates (O(1) instead of O(n)).

### Key numbers

- [12 500+ stars](https://github.com/alibaba/formily)
- [Framework bindings](https://formilyjs.org/guide/quick-start): React + React Native + Vue 2 + Vue 3
- Built-in visual form builder ([Designable](https://designable-antd.formilyjs.org/))
- Used by: [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibaba.com/) internally

### When to choose Formily

- Very large forms (100+ fields) with complex field dependencies
- Need visual form builder (Designable)
- Need Reactive field-level rendering for performance
- Need cross-framework (React + Vue)

### When NOT to choose

- Server-driven UI (Formily is client-centric)
- Java/Spring backend (no native integration)
- Pages with tables, dashboards, custom layouts — Formily is form-only
- Small team — steep learning curve

### How servers store UI

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "x-component": "Input",
      "x-validator": { "required": true }
    }
  }
}
```

Formily extends JSON Schema with `x-*` properties (`x-component`, `x-reactions`, `x-validator`, `x-decorator`).

### Key difference from ProjectForge

Formily is the **most technically advanced form library** with reactive rendering, but it's still a client library. Server provides data schema; client handles all rendering. ProjectForge is server-driven: the server sends the complete UI definition, not just a data schema.

---

## 4. AdminJS

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs) — ⭐ 8 900 | [Website](https://adminjs.co/) | [Docs](https://docs.adminjs.co/) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adminjs) | [Demo](https://demo.adminjs.co/admin)

### What is this

Node.js admin panel framework that auto-generates CRUD interfaces from ORM models.

### How it works

```typescript
import AdminJS from 'adminjs';
import AdminJSMongoose from '@adminjs/mongoose';

const admin = new AdminJS({
  resources: [
    { resource: UserModel, options: {
      properties: { email: { type: 'string', isTitle: true } },
      listProperties: ['id', 'email', 'name'],
      actions: { edit: { isAccessible: (ctx) => isAdmin(ctx) } },
    }},
  ],
});
```

**[8 database adapters](https://docs.adminjs.co/basics/adapters):** TypeORM, Sequelize, Prisma, MikroORM, Mongoose, Objection, SQL, and a base adapter.

**[6 framework plugins](https://docs.adminjs.co/basics/plugins):** Express, NestJS, Hapi, Koa, Fastify.

### Key numbers

- [8 900+ stars](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs)
- [8 database adapters](https://docs.adminjs.co/basics/adapters), [6 framework plugins](https://docs.adminjs.co/basics/plugins)
- [React-based frontend](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/tree/master/frontend) with Redux
- Enterprise version available ([AdminJS Pro](https://adminjs.co/pricing))

### When to choose AdminJS

- Node.js/TypeScript stack
- Need a quick admin panel over existing database tables
- CRUD operations cover most of your admin needs
- Want auto-generated list/show/edit/delete views

### When NOT to choose

- Java/Kotlin/Spring stack (Node.js only)
- Need fully custom pages beyond CRUD
- Need server-driven UI — AdminJS generates admin panels, not flexible layouts
- Need tablets, charts, or complex reporting pages

### How server stores UI

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "id": "User",
    "listProperties": ["id", "email", "name"],
    "actions": [{ "name": "list", "icon": "List" }],
    "properties": { "email": { "isTitle": true, "type": "string" } }
  }
}
```

The server returns **metadata** about resources, properties, and actions. The React frontend uses this metadata to render Bootstrap-based CRUD templates.

### Key difference from ProjectForge

AdminJS is a **CRUD generator** for Node.js. It's opinionated (resources → CRUD actions → templates). ProjectForge is a **full SDUI framework** for Java/Kotlin — you build every page explicitly, with complete control over layout and behavior.

---

## Apache Causeway (formerly Apache Isis)

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/causeway) — ⭐ 890 | [Website](https://causeway.apache.org/) | [Docs](https://causeway.apache.org/docs/) | [Demo](https://demo.causeway.io/)

### What is this

Java framework implementing the **Naked Objects** pattern: the entire UI is auto-generated from domain objects through Java reflection and annotations. No controllers, no templates — just domain objects.

### How it works

```java
@Entity
@DomainObject
public class Person {
    @Property @Title
    public String getName() { ... }

    @Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
    public Person updateName(@Parameter(maxLength = 50) String name) { ... }
}
```

Causeway introspects all `@DomainObject` classes at startup, builds an in-memory metamodel, and renders the UI generically through **Apache Wicket**. Layout can be customized via XML files (`Xxx.layout.xml`).

### Key numbers

- [~890 GitHub stars](https://github.com/apache/causeway), [30 000+ commits](https://github.com/apache/causeway/commits/master)
- [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), [Apache governance](https://www.apache.org/)
- [Production users](https://causeway.apache.org/community/powered-by/): Irish Department of Social Protection (since 2002), [NTT Data](https://www.nttdata.com/), [A1 Telekom](https://www.a1.group/)
- Two viewers: [Wicket](https://wicket.apache.org/) (HTML) + REST API ([Restful Objects spec](http://restfulobjects.org/))
- Security via [SecMan extension](https://causeway.apache.org/docs/latest/extensions/secman/)

### Closest competitor to ProjectForge

Apache Causeway is the **only direct competitor** in the "Java/Kotlin enterprise SDUI" space. Both solve the same problem: the server controls the UI.

| Aspect | Apache Causeway | ProjectForge |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **UI generation** | Automatic, via Java reflection | Explicit, via Kotlin DSL |
| **Control** | Through annotations + XML layout | Through code |
| **Flexibility** | Limited by framework conventions | Full — UI = code |
| **Dev speed** | Very fast (write model only) | Medium (each page manually) |
| **UI framework** | Wicket (server-rendered) | React (client-rendered) |
| **Learning curve** | Need DDD + Causeway annotations | Need to know Kotlin DSL |
| **Enterprise table** | Basic collections | AgGrid (full-featured) |

### When to choose Apache Causeway

- Java/Spring stack, DDD-aligned team
- Domain stable — want UI to update automatically
- Object-action model fits your domain well
- Pixel-perfect UI is not critical
- Small team — Causeway generates complete UIs from domain classes

### When NOT to choose

- Need full control over every page's layout
- UI differs significantly from "object with fields + actions"
- Need complex wizards, multi-step flows, custom dashboards
- Need modern client-rendered UI (React, not Wicket)
- Need enterprise tables (AgGrid, filtering, sorting, export)

### How server stores UI

Causeway stores UI definitions in two forms:

**1. Java annotations:**
```java
@PropertyLayout(fieldSetId = "details", sequence = "1")
@ActionLayout(named = "Update")
```

**2. XML layout files:**
```xml
<bs:row>
  <bs:col span="6">
    <c:fieldSet name="General">
      <c:property id="name"/>
    </c:fieldSet>
  </bs:col>
</bs:row>
```

### Key difference

Causeway follows "domain dictates UI" (Naked Objects pattern). ProjectForge follows "developer builds UI explicitly." Causeway is faster for simple CRUD apps but limited for complex enterprise UIs. ProjectForge gives more control at the cost of more effort per page.

## 5. DivKit (Yandex)

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/divkit/divkit) — ⭐ 2 600 | [Website](https://divkit.tech/) | [Docs](https://divkit.tech/doc) | [Playground](https://divkit.tech/playground) | [JSON Schema](https://divkit.tech/schema)

### What is this

Open-source Server-Driven UI framework from Yandex. Describes UI in JSON ("DivJson") and renders natively on iOS, Android, and Web.

### How it works

```json
{
  "card": {
    "states": [{
      "state_id": 0,
      "variables": [{ "name": "count", "type": "integer", "value": 0 }],
      "div": {
        "type": "container",
        "items": [
          { "type": "text", "text": "@{count}" },
          { "type": "input", "text_variable": "count" }
        ]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

### Key numbers

- [2 600+ stars](https://github.com/divkit/divkit), [185+ releases](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/releases) (latest: [v32.48.0](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/releases/tag/v32.48.0), May 2026)
- [4 700+ commits](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/commits/main)
- [Native clients](https://divkit.tech/doc): [Kotlin](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/tree/main/client/android) (Android), [Swift](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/tree/main/client/ios) (iOS), [TypeScript](https://github.com/divkit/divkit/tree/main/client/web) (Web/React)
- [Server-side JSON builders](https://divkit.tech/doc): TypeScript, Kotlin, Python
- Produced by [Yandex](https://yandex.com/), used in Yandex Browser, Search, Music, Market, Bank, Alice

### Features

- **Contains** (vertical/horizontal/overlap), **gallery**, **grid**, **pager**, **tabs**, **slider**
- **Variables** with `@{var}` expressions and `min/max` functions
- **State machine** — `states[]` with `state_id` transitions
- **Animations** — fade, slide, transition between states
- **Templates** — reusable component definitions with parameterized fields (`$field`)
- **Actions** — `set_variable`, `set_state`, `clear_focus`, `submit`, `download`
- **Custom components** via extension API

### When to choose DivKit

- Need **cross-platform mobile app** (iOS + Android) with SDUI
- Need remote UI updates without App Store releases
- Static screens, cards, feeds, media galleries
- Need native rendering performance on mobile

### When NOT to choose

- Web-only application (DivKit Web uses Svelte, not React natively)
- Complex enterprise forms — no date picker, autocomplete, rich text, file upload
- Java/Spring ecosystem — no server-side integration
- Need complex data tables, sorting, filtering, export

### How server stores UI

```json
{
  "templates": { ... },
  "card": {
    "variables": [ ... ],
    "states": [{
      "div": {
        "type": "container",
        "items": [ ... ]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

Server returns DivJson with the full UI description. Templates are reusable JSON definitions with `$param` substitution, reducing payload size.

### Comparison with ProjectForge

| Aspect | DivKit | ProjectForge |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Platform** | iOS, Android, Web (Svelte) | Web (React) |
| **Rendering** | Native | React DOM |
| **Templates** | ✅ Built-in with params | ❌ Not yet |
| **Variables** | ✅ `@{var + 1}` expressions | ❌ Not yet |
| **Animations** | ✅ State transitions | ❌ None |
| **Complex forms** | ⚠️ Basic input fields | ✅ Full form system |
| **Tables** | ❌ Gallery/grid only | ✅ AgGrid enterprise |
| **Form inputs** | input, textarea, select | input, select, checkbox, radio, date, time, rating, editor, autocomplete, creatable select, dropdown, file upload, attachment list |
| **Enterprise integration** | ❌ None | ✅ Spring Security, JPA, i18n |

### Key difference

DivKit is a **mobile-first SDUI** framework with native rendering on iOS/Android. ProjectForge is a **web-first enterprise SDUI** framework with React on the browser. DivKit excels at animations, templates, and cross-platform mobile. ProjectForge excels at complex forms, enterprise tables, and server integration.

## 6. ProjectForge DynamicLayout

**Links:** [GitHub](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/projectforge-dynamiclayout) | [Docs](.) | [Getting Started](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/projectforge-dynamiclayout/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) | [Architecture](architecture.md)

### What is this

Server-Driven UI framework built into the ProjectForge platform. The server (Kotlin/Spring) defines the UI using a Kotlin DSL, serializes it to JSON, and the React client (`DynamicRenderer`) renders it recursively.

```
Kotlin DSL → JSON (Gson) → DynamicRenderer (React) → DOM
```

### How it works

```kotlin
val layout = UILayout(
  title = I18nKey("user.edit"),
  content = UICol(elements = listOf(
    UIFieldset(title = I18nKey("user.details"), elements = listOf(
      UIInput(id = "name", maxLength = 50),
      UIInput(id = "email", required = true),
    )),
    UIButton(id = "save", responseAction = ResponseAction(type = SAVE)),
  ))
)
```

### Key numbers

- [ProjectForge](https://projectforge.org/) — proprietary enterprise framework
- [30 registered components](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/projectforge-dynamiclayout) in `DynamicRenderer`
- 33 `UIElementType` values, [59 Kotlin UI files](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/projectforge-dynamiclayout/tree/master/projectforge-rest), [90 React components](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/projectforge-dynamiclayout/tree/master/projectforge-webapp)
- Stack: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) / [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) / [React](https://react.dev/) / [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
- [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/MaurerAnton/projectforge-dynamiclayout/blob/master/LICENSE)

### When to choose ProjectForge

- **Enterprise Java/Kotlin + Spring Boot** stack
- Need **full SDUI** — server controls layout, data, actions, and validation
- Complex forms + enterprise tables ([AgGrid](https://ag-grid.com/)) + custom page layouts
- Server-side validation and access control ([Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security))
- Single stack (Kotlin/Java) for UI definition and business logic

### When NOT to choose

- Need forms only — [RJSF](#1-rjsf-react-jsonschema-form) or [JSON Forms](#2-json-forms-eclipsesource) are simpler
- Node.js/Python/Go backend — no native integration outside JVM
- Mobile apps — [DivKit](#5-divkit-yandex) handles iOS/Android natively
- SEO required — client-rendered only, no server-side HTML
- Small forms or quick prototypes — overkill for simple use cases

### How server stores UI

```json
{
  "id": "user.edit",
  "version": "1.0",
  "title": "Edit user",
  "content": [{
    "type": "COL",
    "elements": [{
      "type": "FIELDSET",
      "title": "Details",
      "elements": [
        { "type": "INPUT", "id": "name", "maxLength": 50 },
        { "type": "INPUT", "id": "email", "required": true }
      ]
    }]
  }],
  "actions": [{
    "id": "save",
    "responseAction": { "type": "SAVE", "url": "/api/user", "method": "POST" }
  }]
}
```

### Key difference

ProjectForge is the **only framework** in this comparison that combines: full SDUI (server controls everything) + Kotlin/Spring native integration + enterprise table ([AgGrid](https://ag-grid.com/)) + complete form system (30+ UI components) + server-side validation and access control — all in a single stack.

## Weaknesses of ProjectForge DynamicLayout

### 1. No JSON Schema specification

The JSON format is not formally specified. You cannot validate DynamicLayout JSON on the client, generate layouts from other languages (Python, Go, PHP), or write a type-safe client without reading source code. RJSF and DivKit have published JSON Schema specifications.

### 2. No templates

In DivKit, you can define `"templates": { "userCard": { ... } }` once and reuse with `$param` overrides. In ProjectForge, every layout is serialized from scratch. Repeated structures (address forms, contact cards) are duplicated in every JSON response.

### 3. No variables or expressions

DivKit supports `@{count + 1}`, `@{min(alpha, 0.5)}`, `@{condition ? a : b}`. ProjectForge only has `data[id]` on the client. The server cannot describe dynamic behavior without a round-trip (watchFields → server → ResponseAction).

### 4. Full React tree re-render

Each `setData()` call re-renders the entire DynamicLayout tree. There is no field-level reactivity (Formily solves this at the library level). With 150+ fields, the re-render cost is noticeable.

### 5. No layout caching

The same read-only page for 100 users is generated 100 times. Compare with Spring `@Cacheable` support (which is [now added](../issues.md) but not widely applied).

### 6. Tight to JVM ecosystem

The KMP extraction enables non-JVM targets, but the core is still designed around JVM patterns (Gson, Jackson, Spring annotations). Generating layouts from Node.js or Python would require writing custom serializers.

### 7. Client-side only

Unlike Causeway (server-rendered HTML via Wicket) and AdminJS (SSR-capable), ProjectForge requires JavaScript to render. Empty page without JS, zero SEO, first-load delay while React hydrates.

### 8. React dependency

DynamicRenderer is tied to React. Unlike JSON Forms (React + Angular + Vue) or DivKit (iOS + Android + Web), ProjectForge layouts can only be consumed by React.

## Verdict

### When ProjectForge is the best choice

- **Enterprise Java/Kotlin + Spring Boot** stack
- Need **full SDUI** — server controls not just data but layout, actions, and validation
- Complex forms + enterprise tables (AgGrid) + custom page layouts
- Server-side validation and access control built into UI
- Single stack (Kotlin/Java) for UI definition and business logic

### When to consider alternatives

- **RJSF** / **JSON Forms** — if you need only JSON Schema-based forms in React/Angular/Vue
- **Formily** — if you have 100+ field forms with complex reactive dependencies
- **AdminJS** — if your stack is Node.js and you need a quick CRUD admin panel
- **Apache Causeway** — if your domain is stable and you want zero UI code
- **DivKit** — if you need SDUI for iOS + Android mobile apps

### ProjectForge vs Apache Causeway: main choice for Java projects

| Criterion | ProjectForge | Causeway |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| You want | Control every page explicitly | Auto-generated UI from domain |
| Your domain | Complex, many custom screens | Fits object model naturally |
| UI | React, modern, fully custom | Wicket, Bootstrap, template-like |
| Team size | Resources for UI code | Minimal UI developers needed |
| Change speed | Medium (UI = Kotlin code) | High (UI = annotations + XML) |
| Frontend tech | React | Wicket (server-rendered HTML) |
| Tables | AgGrid enterprise | Basic object collections |
